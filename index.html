							<p>I was born and raised in Bangladesh. I have been good at mathematics and have loved solving mathematical problems since childhood. </p>
							<p>In 2011, I completed a Bachelor's degree in <i>Mathematics</i> at the University of Chittagong, Bangladesh. In 2012, I graduated from the same university with a Master's degree in <i>Applied Mathematics</i>. During this time, I learned various programming languages, including C and C++. I was awarded three gold medals for excellence in mathematics during my bachelor's and master's studies.
							<p>In 2015, I pursued a second Master's degree in <i>Mathematics</i> at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Norway. Among other courses, I studied Cryptography and used MATLAB during my studies there.</p>
							<p>In 2019, I led the teaching of PYTHON for grade 7 when programming was introduced in the Rudolf Steiner School, Gothenburg. I designed, prepared lectures, and taught the course. While teaching the course, I developed a keen interest in computer languages and enjoyed creating beautiful and functional applications. </p>
							<p>In 2022, my interest and capability in mathematical problem-solving led me to pursue a formal education in Computer Science with a focus on Web Development at the Blekinge Institute of Technology, aiming to become a certified full-stack developer and launch a career in tech.</p>
							<p>I worked as a summer worker at Scania in 2023. In my role with the Energy Domain Data Analytics team at Scania, I utilized Python, SQL, Snowflake, and Streamlit for data retrieval, processing, and visualization through plots and dashboards. 
							Recognizing the critical importance of data lineage in ensuring data quality and reliability, I continued my work with the team for my thesis, focusing on data lineage and ETL processes. In my thesis, I tackled challenges such as tracking changes in the data warehouse, SQL queries, and dashboards. For instance, dashboards referencing non-existent database elements caused SQL queries to fail, 
							disrupting operations. Similarly, upstream changes like removing or modifying column names impacted dashboard queries, and outdated documentation hindered stakeholders from accessing accurate information. 
							Additionally, I am currently enrolled in online courses on machine learning and Grafana to refine my expertise in data science, with a focus on visualizing metrics, analyzing time series data, and enhancing application analytics.</p>

								During my recent studies at Blekinge Institute of Technology, specializing in web technologies, I have contributed to both the backend and frontend of numerous web applications. Below is a selection of projects I have developed, either independently or in collaboration with a teammate.
							</p>

											<h3>Single Page Application for Mobile Devices</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This individual examination project for the course <i>Web Applications for Mobile Devices</i> focused on responsive design.  
											The application provides users with real-time information about train delays within Sweden, utilizing data accessed through the Swedish Transportation Administration's (Trafikverket) API. 
											Developed as a single-page application, the project was built using JavaScript and NodeJS with Express.

										<header>
											<h3>Web Application using obeject oriented python</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This project was part of the <i>Algorithms and Data Structures with Object Oriented Python</i> course. 
											This spellchecker helps user to check the spelling. 
											User can even print all of the words of dictionary and change the dictionary as well. In addition, user can search words by entering prefix or suffix.
											 Is is also possible to correct the spell.

											<h3>Web Application using React</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This team project was part of the <i>JavaScript-based Web Framworks</i> course, which focused on gaining proficiency with web frameworks. The application provides users with up-to-date information on train traffic across Sweden, pulling data from the Swedish Transportation Administration (Trafikverket) API.
											This web application was developed with JavaScript, React and NodeJS Express.

											<h3>Data Analysis with Python</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This individual examination project was part of the <i>Mathematical Modelling</i> course.
											I used Python, along with libraries such as <i>pandas</i> and <i>scipy</i>, to analyze 
											the air temperature data for three different temperature stations (Arvidsjaur A, Abisko Aut, Adelsö A) in Sweden.
											When the developed Python script is run, the temperature data is retrieved dynamically using an open data API from 
											the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). 
											The latest 1000 data samples from each station are retrieved, pre-processed, 
											and converted to Python pandas’ data frame for statistical analysis.

											<h3>Design course Website</h3>
										</header>
										<p>										
											This individual project was part of the <i>Technical Web Design and Usability</i> course, where I developed web application for some fictional client—in this case a freelancer web developer. The course emphasized accessible and user-friendly design, allowing me to apply key principles such as hierarchy, composition, and depth. I created two versions of the website, offering both light and dark modes to enhance usability and cater to different user preferences.

											<h3>Thesis: Visualizing Data Lineage & Automating
												Documentation for Data Products</h3>
										</header>
										<p>	
											This thesis is submitted to the Faculty of Computing at Blekinge Institute of Technology in
											partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Higher Education Diploma in Software
											Engineering with emphasis in Web Programming. This projcet is done in collaboration with Scania CV AB, Sweden.																					<!-- This individual project was part of the <i>Technical Web Design and Usability</i> course, where I developed web application for some fictional client—in this case a freelancer web developer.

											In this project, a Python backend is developed that parses SQL queries from various dashboard panels and generates an abstract syntax tree (AST) for each query. The ASTs are used to create a JSON file representing the lineage data in a hierarchical structure. This JSON file provides information about which column is used from which table, which table is used from which schema, and which schema is used from which database. The JSON-formatted data is compared with the data warehouse's database structure to identify failed SQL queries in dashboards. In addition, a frontend is developed, primarily using Vue.js and D3.js, to visualize the data lineage, highlight the failed parts of the dashboard queries, and host documentation for the dashboards. Whenever an AST is modified, the corresponding documentation page is automatically updated to reflect the changes.
